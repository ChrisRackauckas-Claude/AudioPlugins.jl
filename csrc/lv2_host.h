/* lv2_host.h -- hosting an LV2 audio plugin from a synchronous node.
 *
 * The LV2 counterpart of clap_host.h, with the same shape for the same
 * reasons: every entry point is a named symbol in a shared library, every
 * value crossing the node-side boundary is a scalar double, a block is
 * named by a token threaded through `dep`, and every failure is loud.
 *
 * Discovery is lilv's. An LV2 plugin's port layout -- which index is audio
 * in, which is audio out, which is a control and what its range is --
 * lives in Turtle manifests next to the binary, not in the binary, and
 * lilv (with serd, sord, sratom and the LV2 specification bundles) is the
 * reference reader of those manifests. This host asks lilv for the port
 * map and connects every port itself, so a caller names a plugin by URI
 * and never sees a port index unless it wants one.
 *
 * Parameters are the plugin's control INPUT ports, identified by port
 * index (a double, exactly like a CLAP id is a uint32). Latency is the
 * plugin's designated lv2:latency control output port, surfaced and not
 * compensated, exactly like CLAP's.
 *
 * Which plugins this host can open: those whose required features are a
 * subset of what it provides (urid:map, urid:unmap, bufsz:fixedBlockLength,
 * bufsz:boundedBlockLength) and whose ports are audio, control,
 * connection-optional, or atom:AtomPort with atom:Sequence buffer type.
 * Atom ports are connected to one sequence buffer each, sized from the
 * port's declared rsz:minimumSize (LV2_HOST_ATOM_BUF when undeclared):
 * MIDI events reach an input sequence through lv2_in_midi, and an output
 * port is re-headed to an atom:Chunk of full capacity before every run().
 * A plugin that requires a CV or event port, an atom port of another buffer type,
 * or a host feature this host does not offer, is refused at open with a
 * message that says which. Refusing is the honest answer: an unconnected
 * required port is undefined behaviour in the LV2 spec.
